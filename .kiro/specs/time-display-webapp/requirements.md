# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a local, dynamic website that displays the current local time by connecting to Google Public NTP (time.google.com) API. The website will have a user interface inspired by time.is with customizable background functionality, allowing users to upload images as backgrounds with adjustable opacity settings to ensure time visibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the current local time displayed prominently on a webpage, so that I can quickly check the time in an attractive interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webpage loads THEN the system SHALL display the current local time in a large, readable format
2. WHEN time updates THEN the system SHALL refresh the display automatically every second using JavaScript without page refresh
3. WHEN displaying time THEN the system SHALL show hours, minutes, and optionally seconds in a clear format
4. WHEN displaying time THEN the system SHALL indicate AM/PM or use 24-hour format based on user preference
5. WHEN user toggles seconds display THEN the system SHALL show or hide seconds based on user preference
6. WHEN fetching time data THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous JavaScript operations to prevent blocking the UI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the time to be synchronized with Google's NTP servers, so that I can trust the accuracy of the displayed time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to time.google.com NTP API using asynchronous JavaScript to fetch accurate time
2. WHEN NTP connection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to local system time and display a warning
3. WHEN time synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL periodically resync with NTP servers using async operations to maintain accuracy
4. WHEN displaying time THEN the system SHALL show the user's local timezone
5. WHEN making NTP requests THEN the system SHALL use non-blocking asynchronous calls to prevent UI freezing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the background with my own images, so that I can personalize the time display to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click upload background THEN the system SHALL allow me to select an image file from my device
2. WHEN I upload an image THEN the system SHALL set it as the webpage background immediately
3. WHEN background is set THEN the system SHALL maintain the image across browser sessions
4. WHEN no custom background is set THEN the system SHALL display a default attractive background

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to adjust the background opacity, so that the time remains clearly visible regardless of the background image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access opacity controls THEN the system SHALL provide a slider or input to adjust background transparency
2. WHEN I change opacity THEN the system SHALL apply changes in real-time as I adjust the setting
3. WHEN opacity is adjusted THEN the system SHALL ensure time text remains readable with sufficient contrast
4. WHEN opacity settings are changed THEN the system SHALL save the preference for future sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control time display preferences, so that I can customize how the time appears according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access display settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to toggle seconds visibility
2. WHEN I toggle seconds display THEN the system SHALL immediately update the time format
3. WHEN I change display preferences THEN the system SHALL save these settings for future sessions
4. WHEN seconds are hidden THEN the system SHALL display only hours and minutes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be similar to time.is, so that I have a familiar and clean user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, minimalist interface similar to time.is
2. WHEN displaying elements THEN the system SHALL use large, bold typography for the time display
3. WHEN showing controls THEN the system SHALL keep customization options subtle and non-intrusive
4. WHEN on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design principles

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the current date displayed alongside the time, so that I have complete date and time information in one view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webpage loads THEN the system SHALL display the current date in the format "Tuesday, 14 October, 2025, week 42"
2. WHEN the date changes THEN the system SHALL update the date display automatically at midnight
3. WHEN displaying the date THEN the system SHALL show the day of week, day, month, year, and week number
4. WHEN time updates THEN the system SHALL ensure date accuracy matches the displayed time zone

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view world clocks for different time zones, so that I can easily see the time in multiple locations simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access world clock settings THEN the system SHALL allow me to select up to 3 different time zones to display
2. WHEN world clocks are enabled THEN the system SHALL display them in a layout similar to time.is world clock design
3. WHEN world clocks update THEN the system SHALL refresh all time zone displays simultaneously every second
4. WHEN I configure world clocks THEN the system SHALL save my selected time zones for future sessions
5. WHEN displaying world clocks THEN the system SHALL show the city name, current time, and date for each selected time zone
6. WHEN world clocks are shown THEN the system SHALL maintain the clean, minimalist design consistent with the main time display

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to work locally without internet dependency for basic functionality, so that I can use it even when offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue displaying time using local system clock
2. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL not require external server dependencies for core functionality
3. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL maintain all customization features including background and opacity settings
4. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resync with NTP servers
